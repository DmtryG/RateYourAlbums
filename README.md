# RateYourAlbums

<img src="Images/promo.png">

RateYourAlbums is an open-source application for rating music albums. It's built entirely in SwiftUI

## Why?
I don't find it very convenient to use platforms like Album of the Year or RateYourMusic, which are essentially web apps. Every single time I want to log an album, I have to open a browser and deal with a slow, clunky interface, wasting a lot of time. This app primarily solves my own problem with rating and tracking the albums I have listened to, but I'm sure it will be useful to someone else as well

## Features
The app is divided into two tabs: «Rated», which contains albums you have rated, and «To-Listen», which contains albums you want to listen to in the future. Various sorting options are implemented, as well as search by album title and artist within the library. Album search is performed using the iTunes API
